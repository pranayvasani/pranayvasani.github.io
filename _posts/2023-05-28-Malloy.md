# Malloy

I was reading about [Malloy](https://www.malloydata.dev/) since long but once I saw a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmJgwc3oPI) from Lloyd Tabb i immediately jumped in to try it out.

Uploaded my experiment and underlying data [here](https://github.com/pranayvasani/malloy)

Once you open matches.malloy file just press `.` on your keyboard and it will open up online vscode editor which will allow you to preview and run different queries.

As a comparison i tried to simulate all the analysis that I had done long time ago with python and altair which is present [here](https://github.com/pranayvasani/python/tree/master/python_altair_ipl)

Malloy has a very good [documentation](https://malloydata.github.io/documentation/) and once you start it is very easy to learn.

I want to experiment more with Malloy especially how it performs with relatively large data and the different analysis that one does from exploration standpoint
