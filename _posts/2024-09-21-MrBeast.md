# How To Succeed In MRBEAST Production

Strangely, I had never heard of MRBEAST before until my son showed me his videos on Youtube where he does unique things.

In fact during our visit to UK, he made me purchase [feastables](https://feastables.com/), no wonder his biggest audience is male/teen/video game players.

I must say his production house does create unique and engaging videos.

A few days ago a playbook got leaked which read `How to succeed in MRBEAST production`

This guy knows a lot, I don't think I should dare to summarize what I learnt, every word in the document is a pearl and it can be applied to anyone, any profession, any where.

Receipe for how to become best in your field, great practical advice all learnt and experienced by himself.

People in his company must be learning and enjoying a lot at the same time.

Simply just go read it.
