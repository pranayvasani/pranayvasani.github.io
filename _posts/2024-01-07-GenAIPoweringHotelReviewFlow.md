# GenAI Powering Hotel Review Flow

My parents are visiting Rajshthan and they completed their stay in one of the hotels at Jaipur.
The hotel was booked through [agoda](https://www.agoda.com/).
I recived an email from agoda to write review for the stay.
I generally don't write reviews but somehow I decided to complete the process as hotel stay was nice and comfortable.
To my surprise I found that agoda has embedded GenAI in their review process.
It starts with asking one to rate (liked or not liked) the hotel on a few parameters like location, cleanliness, staff, facilities etc. and depending on your response generates the review using GenAI which you can decide to use as it is or modify yourself based on your preferences which I think is cool.

It saves me writing long reviews and helps me tweak if need be. Good stuff agoda.

Here are some screenshots for reference.
