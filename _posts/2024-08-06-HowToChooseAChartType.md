If you are remotely connected to the world of data visualization or create a chart as part of your profession just simply go and watch these.
It will be a well spent 120 minutes of your day.

* Had never heard of arrow chart type, don't think any BI tool natively supports it
* Recommendations or guidelines given are super helpful and practical but I was just thinking BI tools won't be able to support them out of the box as they must be handcrafted as per the case and message you want to communicate e.g. coloring parts of visuals, providing annotations at the right data points, arranging them to communicate message as per the recommendation and reduce the cognitive load on consumer of the visualization
* That is the reason interactive graphics created by NY Times or other publishers or so called Data visualization whizards/designers (which I assume are mostly handcrafted) are so appealing than the ones created by BI tools
