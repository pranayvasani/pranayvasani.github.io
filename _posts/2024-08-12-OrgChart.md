# Config Conference 2024 by Figma 

Config conference by Figma happened between June 26th to 27th 2024.

Though I haven't gone through the one which I went through was [The heirloom tomato org chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4vvBidQcck&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx402DljIPagaDKLibF-qfF0&index=56&pp=iAQB) by Nan Yu from Linear.

What I liked
* Presentation (slides) were super cool, and slides and delivery followed what every presentation coach teaches you
* I could relate to [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) 
* Don't blindly follow the model that worked for someone, their circumstance, situation, timing, context could be all different than yours. Learn from the models but adapt it to your needs and moreover think what you need to accomplish or what matters to you most
