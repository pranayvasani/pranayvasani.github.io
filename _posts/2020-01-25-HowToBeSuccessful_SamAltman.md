# How to be successful by Sam Altman

I would recommend reading Sam Altman's classic [blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) on how to be successful. 

My take aways from the blog are as below.

* **Don't stop learning** - Your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results.

* **Always add value** - It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever

* **Be a charismatic leader** - Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. Learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.


* **Be a clear communicator** - My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.

* **Value your time** - It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

* **Be Bold** - Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well

* **Build your leverage** - If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money. The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.

* **Own the equity** - You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly
