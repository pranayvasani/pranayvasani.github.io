# Novo Nordisk

I came across this [blog](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/novo-nordisk-ozempic) on the history of Novo Nordisk's 100 years as a company.

What I liked the most is:
* I didn't listen to the episode instead I read the transcript 
* One thing I realized is one should write as if one is talking - that makes a lot of impact
* The amount of research depth that has gone into putting this podcast is enormous and it shows up once you go through it. Ben and David have done a fantastic job. It is simply inspiring
* I just could not stop reading the transcript and i binge-read the article to be honest
* I don't think I should try to summarize the article, one should just go and read or listen to it
* I got to learn so much about Diabetes, Novo Nordisk, Pharma Industry, How Innovation works in Pharma and so many other things

Still for those who want to get a sneak peak into it, i tried summarizing twice with different prompts with MS Co pilot.
Here are both the versions.
