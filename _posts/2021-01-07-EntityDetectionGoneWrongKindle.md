# Dumb Machines

A few days ago when I was reading on a kindle, I liked a feature of kindle showing the meaning of the complex word just on top of it. 
You can read [here](https://pranayvasani.github.io/2021/01/01/ReadingOnAmazonKindle.html) about it. 


I encountered one instance in the book where it seemed that those meaning just pop up without understanding the context (words adjancent to it) of the word. 
Here Viral Oza is a name of the person but Viral was detected as a stand alone word and its meaning was shown accordingly.

May be Amazon Kindle team can do a better job at detecting the entities in the sentence and then showing the meaning for it.
NLP is hard.
