# Dumb Machines

A few days ago when I was reading on a kindle, I liked a feature of kindle showing the meaning of the complex word just on top of it. 
You can read [here](https://pranayvasani.github.io/2021/01/01/ReadingOnAmazonKindle.html) about it. 

I encountered one instance in the book where it seemed that those meaning just pop up without understanding the context (words adjancent to it) of the word.

May be Amazon Kindle team can do a better job at detecting the entities and then showing the meaning for it.
NLP is head.
