# Dall-E Experiments

With all happening in AI space at the moment with chatGPT, Stable Diffusion etc. I decided to explore OpenAI and Dall-E to begin with.
I decided to involve my son in the process as he is also quite curious and quick to learn.
So we went to [OpenAI's Dall-E playground](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to try our hands with it.

It is very easy to get started, all you need to do is sign up and directly start playing with it.

I being a product person, I liked the way how easy it is for anyone to get started (friction to onboarding is zero).
Additionally they have kept the interface super minimal and easy to use with a few examples that you can explorer right then and there to try out your ideas and from which you can take inspriration as well.

Here is a [public collection](https://labs.openai.com/c/y16wfJ7g4Mq5R2x4gPeAlxsW) of a few sentences that we tried to create the images.

In Summary it was a fun experience and it was good to see my son getting excited about it as he himself is an artist (he sketches) and came up with pretty interesting scenarios to see what Dall-E responded with.

We liked most of the things generated by Dall-E and with some we were not so impressed.

Hopefully we will experiment more and share more results. It gives you some 50 credits on signup (I need to understand what does that mean, 50 attempts/sentencens that you can try may be).
