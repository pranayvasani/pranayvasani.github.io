# Experiments with Digital Art

Inspried from my son's ability to draw masterfully on paper as well as on digital medium, I decided to try my hands on digital art. Ever since I saw [Procreate] (https://procreate.art/) in action, I had decided to buy my son an iPad with magic pencil and 
had promised him that Procreate will be the first app that we will download on iPad.

In fact i had subscribed to [Art with Flo's] (https://artwithflo.com/) Youtube channel even before we purchased iPad.

My son picked up Procreate and drawing pretty fast. I must tell you that Procreate is one of the very products/apps that I have used in recent past which is an idiot proof. It is a paradise for people interested in drawing and art.
Even though I don't have any interest or training for drawing I could create drawings with it in no time. Of course Flo's instructional videos are awesome and I don't want to take anything away from her unique style of teaching how to draw with Procreate.

I watched couple of videos from [her] (https://www.youtube.com/c/ArtwithFlo?) and drew these drawings to satisfy my creative brain :)

I hope to continue this hobby in 2022 and get better at it.

Last but not the least thanks to my son for inspiring me, he knew I could draw and he kept me pushing to try atleast once before I wrongly conclude I can't draw :).
