# Reading on Amazon Kindle

One of the goals for 2021 that I have for myself is to start reading more. My goal is to read one book a month which means by the end of the year I would have read 12 books. I had purchased Amazon kindle long back but except couple of books I hadn't read much on it.

The first book that I have picked up is [Stories At Work by Indranil Chakraborty](https://www.amazon.in/Stories-At-Work-Business-Storytelling/dp/0670089842/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=61600871400&dchild=1&ext_vrnc=hi&gclid=CjwKCAiAirb_BRBNEiwALHlnDwTaEV9Gsj1f673_E0gxXU_SAFO07ZiiLK_vh71UUvpBr9DfNqpZ8xoCTBsQAvD_BwE&hvadid=356411414776&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9062108&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=17758321928991579733&hvtargid=kwd-375583495186&hydadcr=18038_1933611&keywords=stories+at+work&qid=1609480832&s=books&sr=1-1&tag=googinhydr1-21)
I might write my take-aways from the book once I finish it but the purpose of writing this post was to share one of the point that struck and stuck with me about kindle while reading on it.

I am pretty sure those who read a lot on a kindle, it might be nothing new.

So kindle highlights the meaning of some of the complex words on top of it in a very subtle way so that it fulfills below objectives:
1. The meaning of the word is positioned atop of the original word in such a way that it doesn't appear intrusive at all
2. The best thing about it is that it doesn't distract or doesn't allow user to go away anywhere from the task under consideration (which is reading in this case) as the help (the meaning of the word in this case for those who might want to find out the actual meaning of the complex word) appears contextual/inline

A few observations for those who are building products it is so important to keep your users in mind all the time and make their life easier to accomplish their tasks/objectives.
