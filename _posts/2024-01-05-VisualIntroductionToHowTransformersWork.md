# Visual Introduction To How Transformers Work

I came across a very visually intuitive and a simple explanation of how [transformers](https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/) work by Financial Times.

I also used MS Copilot to generate summary of this article :D and it was fun.

Sure, here is a more comprehensive summary of the article:

* The article explains what generative AI is, how it works, what are its applications, and what are its challenges.
* Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new data, such as images, text, music, or code, based on existing data and patterns. It can produce realistic and coherent outputs that are hard to distinguish from human-made ones.
* Generative AI uses a model called a transformer, which can learn from large amounts of data and generate outputs that are relevant to the input. A transformer consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder converts the input into a representation that captures its meaning and context. The decoder uses this representation to generate the output, word by word or pixel by pixel.
* Generative AI can be used for various purposes, such as content creation, data augmentation, product design, quality control, and human oversight. For example, generative AI can create realistic images of faces, landscapes, or products, based on a description or a sketch. It can also generate text, such as headlines, captions, summaries, or stories, based on a topic or a prompt. It can also create music, such as melodies, harmonies, or lyrics, based on a genre or a mood. It can also generate code, such as software, web pages, or apps, based on a specification or a template.
* Generative AI also poses some ethical, legal, and social issues, such as plagiarism, misinformation, bias, and regulation. For example, generative AI can create fake or misleading content, such as deepfakes, fake news, or spam, that can harm individuals or society. It can also copy or infringe on the intellectual property or the privacy of others. It can also reflect or amplify the biases or the errors of the data it was trained on. It can also challenge or disrupt the existing norms or regulations of various domains or industries.
