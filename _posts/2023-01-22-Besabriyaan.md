I have watched [M.S. Dhoni - the untold story](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4169250/) atleast couple of times and have heard the song [Besabriyaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBBHpoW3AKA) quite a few times but it is until very recently on my way to office I heard the lyrics with attention and it is now one of my favourite songs. In fact I asked my son also to listen to it and he also liked it. He is a big fan of music.

I literally got goose bumps listening to some of the lines of the song.

Here is my takeaway from the song and somehow everyone can relate to it as almost everyone goes through similar circumstances in life as depicted in the movie.

* Demand more from life
* Don't worry about what future holds for you
* Let the fire in the belly or not being ok with what life throws at you (my interpretation of besabariyaan) take you to places
* Have trust in yourself and nothing is impossible
* Your desire and thirst are your weapons
* Don't get bogged down by ups/downs and light/darkness of life
* Find light within yourself
* Be your own guide don't follow or look out for anyone's footsteps, find your own direction

I feel something is about to happen in life again :P
