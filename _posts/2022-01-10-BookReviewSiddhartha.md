# Book Review Siddhartha

Based on Naval's recommendation I read [Siddhartha by Herman Hesse](https://www.amazon.in/Siddhartha-Hermann-Hesse/dp/0553208845).

One of my goal for the year 2022 and hence forth is to read more. 
I am not an avid reader but I could complete this book in 2 days and the reason for that is this book just flows and it keeps you engaged so you don't feel like dropping it and makes you read without putting it down. Besides it is a short book about 120 pages long.

I have never written a review of the book nor do I know the process but I am going to write my take aways and some pointers from the book which I liked.

What is the meaning of life? That is a question everyone has to answer for themselves. There is no right or an ultimate answer.

When you would discover the meaning of life for yourself that also depends so you need to keep on finding it, the way Siddharth went through different phases of life. 

I feel that it kind of relates with how our life is also organized, we come to life then we study try to get the knowledge when we are young, we want to shine amongs our peers and take pride in it that we are the most knowledgeable. Then we go through the phase where everything seems just useless so we take different path and just work as hard as we can, try to sacrifice lot of things on the way. Then we enter into marriage, have kids, get into societal and material things etc. And when none of these give peace to us we go into old age trying to understand how life went by, what are children are doing, try to reflect etc. and still find a peace.

Siddharth couldn't find solace in Buddha's teaching as well so find your own path to peace to atman to one to unity.

Some people get it some people even after following one path their entire life can't get to it so keep on finding it. Don't seek.

It is when you seek you can't find because you become biased, blinded with your thinking and can't find things which are under your nose. Keep an open mind and experience the life as it comes to you. 

Listen without bias, without judgement. 

Give to get.

Experience everything. 

Everything in life comes from compounding as Naval says so don't do things always keeping yourself in the center, do things beyond the actual objective that is when things will come to you in return.

Just flow like a river with complete harmony with the universe and you may find peace.

Wisdom can't be communicated.

Don't be under illusion that you will get to somewhere where you want to be or try to measure how far you are from that state.
It is already here right now so be in present.
