# Dictation in MS Windows

I started seeing lot of people have started saving their keystrokes and instead rely on speech-to-text capabilities on their machine for dictation purposes.

I was looking for a good alternative to [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) on Windows and realized that Windows has built-in very sophisticated dictation feature that works with any application.

It is called [voice access](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/get-started-with-voice-access-bd2aa2dc-46c2-486c-93ae-3d75f7d053a4) and you enable it by win+ctrl+s command (atleast it worked for me) on Windows 11.

Configure it how you wish and save your keystrokes.

Just highlight the application or keep it in focus where you want output of dictation to go and I must say quality is really good. 

It can also run commands, pretty cool!
