# How to write good documentation

I firmly believe that doing a good job of documenting things is a key to success regardless which area of your life you deal with. We humans deal with language in the form of verbal, written and expressions for all our communication needs. Working in a software field is no different where majority of the issues (atleast based on my little experience) would not occur or will get eliminated to an extent if people do a good job of documentation.

I came across [this](https://documentation.divio.com/) master piece on how to do documentation right.

The [video](https://youtu.be/t4vKPhjcMZg) on the page is an interesting talk explaining the concepts in a compressed manner.

Do give it a watch, worth the time.

The picture summarizes the concept beautifully.
