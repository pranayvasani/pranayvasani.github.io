excerpt: "Seven findings from 92 years of World Cup data. Three you already knew. Four you didn't."
---

I spent a weekend with the Fjelstul World Cup database (964 matches, 2,720 goals, 22 tournaments) and built [an interactive flipbook](https://pranayvasani.github.io/fifa_worldcup_flipbook/) out of it.

The structure is two chapters, on purpose.

**📺 The Known** is three things every pundit already says, confirmed with numbers. Score first, win 73% of the time. A home-team red card crashes win-rate from 58% to 18%. More bookings in a match means a tighter scoreline. Cards *are* the tension, not the cause of it.

These were the boring part to verify. They were also the necessary part. Without them, the second chapter has nothing to push against.

**💡 The Aha** is four findings that have been sitting in the data the whole time and almost nobody talks about:

- The **Soviet Union** won 58% of group matches and 14% of knockouts. Statistically the best team in the world at the part of the tournament that doesn't count.
- The **Netherlands** drop 18 percentage points from group to knockout. The most precise number anyone has ever put on 50 years of heartbreak.
- **West Germany** converted 13 of 14 shootout penalties: 92.9%. We've written a library about England's misses (57.9%). Nobody asks why Germany never missed.
- Since 2010, **10.2% of all World Cup goals happen after the 90th minute**. Before 1990, the number was zero. The final whistle is not where you think it is.

The thing I keep coming back to is the West Germany stat. The story we tell about penalty shootouts is built around England's pain. The data has another, equally interesting story (one country that simply never missed) and the conversation has never made room for it. The interesting part of the data isn't the data. It's the gap between what people repeat and what's actually there.

A few notes on the build:

**Don't trust me. Verify it.** Every number in the flipbook can be reproduced from the raw CSVs. The repo ships a [`verify_worldcup_stories.py`](https://github.com/pranayvasani/fifa_worldcup_flipbook/blob/main/verify_worldcup_stories.py) script that auto-downloads the source data, runs each story end-to-end, and prints ✓/✗ per claim. If a number is wrong, open an issue and I'll fix the flipbook.

**It's a flipbook, not a dashboard.** Most "data viz" defaults to a dashboard: filters, drilldowns, an invitation to explore. I wanted the opposite. A fixed sequence, newspaper typography, a goal-margin chart that exists for exactly one paragraph and then goes away. The reader's job is to read, not to operate the UI.

**Two chapters earn each other.** "The Known" matters because it makes "The Aha" feel earned. If I'd opened with West Germany's 92.9%, you'd have no reason to care. By the time you get there, you've already agreed with three things the data confirmed, so the fourth (the one that breaks the pattern) actually lands.

**Read time is ~1 minute.** That was the only hard constraint. If you can't get someone through a data essay in the time it takes to ride an elevator, you don't have a data essay, you have a project.
