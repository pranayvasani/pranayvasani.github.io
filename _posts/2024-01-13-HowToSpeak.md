I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY) by professor [Patrick Winston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston) on how to speak.

My takeaways:
* Success or quality of what one does is a function of Knowledge, Practice and Talent one has
* Knowledge and practice of that knowledge far outperforms the innate talent that one has
* Ability to speak, write and having ideas determines success in life
* There are various styles and methodologies one can adapt for different types of communication as discussed in the lecture
* Do not start your talk with a Joke but you can end it with a Joke
* Start your talk/presentation with a promise to your audience what they will achieve at the end of the talk/presentation
* Do not loose contact with your audience 
* The setup (light, air etc.) where talk is given is equally important as speaker and audience
* Use your hands not the laser pointer while talking/presenting
* Be as close to slides rather than away from it
* Use props, board as applicable
* Tell stories
* Repeat your theme/point atleast three times
* Use complicated concept only once in your talk/presentation
* Eliminate all you can on your slides even bullets, logos, slide header etc.
* We have only one language processor so don't make your audience read the slide, make them hear you
* Don't end slide with thank you, Q&A, end etc. end it with a joke or your contributions
* Only thank audience if they applaud or appreciate you :) 


## Summary of video created by MS Copilot:

The video is a lecture by Patrick Winston on how to speak effectively in various situations, such as informing, persuading, or inspiring an audience. He covers topics such as how to start and stop a talk, how to use boards, props, and slides, and how to apply some heuristic rules to improve your speaking ability. The lecture is part of the MIT OpenCourseWare series and has been dubbed using an artificial voice to increase accessibility. You can find more information about the lecture and the course at MIT OpenCourseWare.

I think i did better in summarizing video than AI agents/copilots :P
