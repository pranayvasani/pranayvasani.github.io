# Docker and Container Basics

Found a great article on understanding Docker and  Container basics [here](https://technically.substack.com/p/whats-docker-and-what-are-containers)

I really wonder how some people can explain the concepts so clearly.
What I liked about this post/article
* Style of writing
* Diagrams are super cool (not sure which tool is used to create them)
* At the end of the post revisiting the concepts covered
