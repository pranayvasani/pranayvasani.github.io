# AI Function In Google Sheets

Google introduced [AI function](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/15877199?hl=en_SE) in alpha and I gave it a try for a few use cases which I come across on a day to day basis for my work, some of which I solve through formulae.

Go through how to use it and its limitations (link above) before reading further.

This is just a first attempt getting familiarized with AI Function so I would like to play around more to understand its strengths/weaknesses/limitations/behavior etc.
