# AI at help for extracting customer feedback 

One of our customers provided us feedback in an email about the artifacts delivered to them. Though they stuck to pretty consistent format say artifact name, feedback with bullet points and screenshot for each observation/feedback, there were certain observations which didn't follow the same structure.

I wanted to extract out the feedback in a tabular format for better tracking and communication.

We use Google workspace at work so decided to ask Gemini to convert the contents of the email especially the feedback provided into structured format like artifact name, feedback/observation etc. and it did a pretty decent job of going through entire mail trail and generated a table accurately.

Not that I couldnot have done it manually in short time but it is obvious that these models can do these kind of jobs pretty accurately and in no time. 

Definitely save 15 to 20 minutes for me.
