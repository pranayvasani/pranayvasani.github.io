# AI at help while writing email

Not sure when this feature appeared in Gmail but this morning I was construting an email in which I intended to attach a document but forgot and hit send button. Gmail showed me a warning message stating "It seems like you forgot to attach a file. You wrote "attached is" in your message but there are no files attached. Send anyway?" 
Such a nifty feature to ensure that you don't have to recall or resend an email with attachment later.
