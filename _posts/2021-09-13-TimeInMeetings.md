# Time In Meetings

Ever since full time remote work has started (post COVID) the number of meetings have increased drastically. It is also the by product of the role that I am playing in my team now, less of an individual contributor more of problem solver and ensuring things are moving in right direction for the team.

We use Google at workplace, so off late I was anyways looking for a tool or a way to export out my calendar data to see how I spend my day.

This morning when I saw Google Calendar, to my pleasant surprise i saw Time Insights introduced by them. ![TImeInsights](../images/time_insights.png?raw=true)


Look forward to use this for my own analysis.

I will share more once I have good analysis to share.
